## Requirements
Your site will have several sections of content.

The site can be a single page that contains all sections, or a single HTML page for each section.

Initially, you must create the content sections themselves. Do not worry about completing each section. You will change the site as you gain more experience.

> A single-page website is useful for:
> * Small websites
> * Linear user experience
> * Mobile users (scrolling)


### About
A description of you, the developer, and you, the person. This should be a couple paragraphs that allow you to sell yourself to potential employers.

### Projects
For each project you would like to feature, provide at least:
* A short description.
* A link to the Github _README.md_ for your project repo.
  * The _README.md_ should include any instructions necessary for using the project, such as a login/password.
* If the project is one that runs on the Web, include a link to the running project on AWS.

### Contact
This is your contact information. If you are uncomfortable putting your phone number or personal email online, just put your GitHub account info for now.

### Resume
Add a link to your resume. PDF format is best. If you don't want to post your resume with contact info, list your work experience, skills, education, etc.
